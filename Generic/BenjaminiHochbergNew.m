function [h,pThreshold,i1,pAdjusted] = BenjaminiHochbergNew(p,fdr,twoStageFlag)
%Performs the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to determine significance in
%multiple comparisons while controlling the False Discovery Rate (number of 
%false positives as a % of the number of total comparisons). This is a
%less taxing alternative to performing a Bonferroni correction, for example.
%FDR control is done in expectation over many realizations.
%
%INPUT:
%p: vector of p-values from the multiple comparisons, has to be 1-D
%fdr: value in [0,1] that determines the (expected) False Discovery Rate that is
%tolerated
%twoStageFlag: if true, it performs the two-stage procedure suggested in
%Benjamini, Krieger and Yekuteli 2006, which maintains fdr control
%guarantees (under independent tests) but has more power. Default = false.
%OUTPUT:
%h= binary vector that is 1 if the corresponding p-value was deemed
%significant, and 0 if not.
%pThreshold = value that ends up being the cut-off for p. Should satisfy:
%h = p<=pThreshold = pAdjusted<fdr
%i1 = no. of significant results, equals sum(h)
%pAdjusted = adjusted p-values
